pivore
======

Code for a simple Raspberry Pi-based photovore robot

The pivore is my first robot ever. Basic components are:
- Raspberry Pi
- Magician chassis from Sparkfun
- L293D motor driver
- MCP23008 I/O expander
- MCP3008 analog/digital converter
- 2 light-dependent resistors (a.k.a. photocells)

It's all cobbled together on a breadboard, and the Pi is held in a vertical position 
somewhat precariously by plastic spacers.
